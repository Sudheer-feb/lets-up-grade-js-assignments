        <h1> Question 3: </h1>
        <h2> Write a brief intro on available data types in java script ? </h2>
             <h3>answer : </h3> 
             <h3>data types in java script.</h3>
             <p>
                Data types basically specify what kind of data can be stored and manipulated within a program.There are six basic data types in JavaScript which can be divided into three main categories: primitive (or primary),
                 composite (or reference), and special data types. String, Number, and Boolean are primitive data types. Object, Array, and Function 
                 (which are all types of objects) are composite data types. Whereas Undefined and Null are special data types.
                 Primitive data types can hold only one value at a time, whereas composite data types can hold collections of values 
                 and more complex entities. Let's discuss each one of them in detail.
             </p>
             <h3> string data types in java script.</h3>
             <p>
                The string data type is used to represent textual data (i.e. sequences of characters). 
                Strings are created using single or double quotes surrounding one or more characters.
             </p>
             <p id="string"> </p> 
             <script> var a = 'Hi there!';  // using single quotes
                      var b = "Hi there!";  // using double quotes
                      document.getElementById("string").innerHTML = a+b; </script>
                    
            <h3>The Number Data Type </h3>
            <p> The number data type is used to represent positive or negative numbers with or without decimal place, or numbers written 
                using exponential notation e.g. 1.5e-4 (equivalent to 1.5x10-4).
            </p>
            <p id="number"> </p>
            <script>
                var x = 25;         // integer
                var y = 80.5;       // floating-point number
                var z = 4.25e+6;    // exponential notation, same as 4.25e6 or 4250000
                var q = 4.25e-6;    // exponential notation, same as 0.00000425
                document.getElementById("number").innerHTML = x+<br>+y+<br>+z+<br>+q; 
            </script>
